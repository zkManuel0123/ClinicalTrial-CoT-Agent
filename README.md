# ClinicalTrial-CoT-Agent
## Overview

This repository contains the code and experimental results for the paper "Inspecting Clinical Trial Inference through Chain-of-Thought and Dual-Agent reasoning with Large Language Models". This project is based on the SemEval 2024 Task 2 competition: "Safe Biomedical Natural Language Inference for Clinical Trials".
The dataset and parts of the code are referenced and cloned from the [SemEval 2024 Task 2 official repository](https://github.com/ai-systems/Task-2-SemEval-2024).

## Repository Structure
**Main directory:** Contains the running code for various models used in this experiment

**.env** file: Stores API keys for the models used

**output folder**: Contains experimental results

## Usage
1. Clone this repository
  
2. Configure .env file with your required API keys
  
3. Run the appropriate model code

## Acknowledgements
Thanks to the SemEval 2024 Task 2 organizers for providing the dataset and baseline code.
